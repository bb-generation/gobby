1. Synopsis

   Gobby is a free collaborative editor. This means that it
   provides you with the possibility to edit files simultaneously
   with other users over a network. The platforms on which you could use
   Gobby are so far Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and other
   Unix-like ones. Developed with the GTK+ toolkit it integrates
   nicely into the GNOME desktop environment if you want it to.

4.1. How to report bugs

   Bugs could be filed as tickets at http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/newticket or
   submitted directly to us at crew@0x539.de. Please include a
   reachable email address in your bug report as we often need to
   contact the reporters for clarifications. Commonly bugs are
   scheduled for the next major release and will be listed in the
   roadmap.
     _________________________________________________________

4.2. How to get involved

   We urgently seek all kind of people who could help us in any
   way. Firstly we need documentation writers who could help us
   crafting a help file and some standalone documentation for the
   web. Secondly, if you are skilled in C/C++ programming, we could
   need helping hands with programming. You could use our project
   page as a starting point to look for tickets which need
   fixing. And last, but certainly not least, we need translators
   who get their hands at Gobby's string templates to get it
   localised. Thus more could use Gobby in their native language.
   Just contact us, if in doubt, for more details.

   There are also two mailing lists which should provide a mean
   of contact to other Gobby users and to the developers.

     * obby-announce: A moderated list used to announce new
       releases of Gobby and its foundation, net6, obby and libinfinity.
       Please refer to
       http://list.0x539.de/mailman/listinfo/obby-announce if you
       want to subscribe it.
     * obby-users: Discussions about Gobby's usage and
       installation problems. The announcements are also posted
       there. Please refer to
       http://list.0x539.de/mailman/listinfo/obby-announce if you
       want to subscribe it.
